    <div class="article-content wrapper" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>I think we can say that we have essentially figured out how to design websites. Today, the idea of a fixed-width page designed to fit in a very specific resolution, cluttered with distracting graphics, modal windows, popups and whatnots, and content copy-pasted from jargon-laden PDF brochures seems ludicrous. We know the why, the what and the how to create websites that help people and businesses.</p>

<p>Our mastery of the craft has matured. The Web is not considered as the offspring of print and TV anymore; it has its own body of knowledge, its science, its engineering and its art. All the elements that make up web pages are now under our complete control… all except advertisements.</p>

<p>To most of us, the word itself is repulsive; its simple utterance brings scores of bad memories to our minds: from years and years of unsolicited sales pitches (both on- and offline) to unscrupulous techniques to trick us into buying something. It is not surprising that we react so negatively though, today’s advertising—i.e. the many annoying ways it manifests itself in inside a page—isn’t any different from the salesman of yesteryear forcing his foot into the door so that you have no choice but to listen to what he has to say.</p>

<p>And yet, advertising is a necessity. Many businesses, in the publishing industry in particular, depend on it. Without it, there is no money, and without money, there is no content. In that sense, they’re not very different from forms: nobody <em>wants</em> to use them, but everybody <em>has</em> to at some point. </p>

<p>To me, the problem cannot be better summarised than by unearthing the tension that lies at the heart of advertising, which is that both advertising and content&mdash;the very content it’s making possible to produce&mdash;vie for the same limited resource: users’ attention. Stated like that, it is unsurprising that, given the limited amount of screen real estate they get, advertisers would go to great lengths to (literally) capture users’ attention, sometimes going as far as using black-hat techniques.</p>

<p>Isn’t there a way out of this? Is there a world where content and advertising could go hand in hand? In other words: can advertising contribute to, rather than fight against, a great overall user experience? Just like <a href="http://www.lukew.com/resources/web_form_design.asp">for forms</a>, yes I believe it can. And if anything, this seems to be a fascinating design challenge.</p>

<h2>The state of advertising</h2>

<p>One should not look very long to form an opinion on the current state of in-page ads.</p>

<h3>They are the epitome of ugliness</h3>

<p>When was the last time you stared at an ad, in awe, thinking how great it looked and how well it inserted itself within the narrative of the page? Let me guess: <em>Never</em>. How often have you scrolled past that ugly blinking thing and paid zero attention to what it was trying to say? <em>Always</em>, right?</p>

<p>Notice something here? It seems striking to me that the very first reason why people overlook ads is <em>because many of them were intentionally designed to provoke such a reaction</em>. This is flabbergasting to say the least, given how obvious it is that the only result one can hope for is sheer repulsion. I think we can all agree this is practically bad both for the consumer who is subjected to those atrocities, and to the businesses being represented by the ads themselves.</p>

<p>And yet, they keep on being designed that way, despite the many studies that have shown the effect of aesthetics on subjective credibility and usability. <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/alberteins133991.html">Insanity</a>.</p>

<p>It doesn’t take an artist to notice how ugly they are. Like grease stains on an otherwise clean page, they look amateurish and jarring. <strong>It’s no wonder web designers hate them.</strong></p>

<h3>They are the anti-experience</h3>

<p>Some of the worst usability mistakes on the Web involve the presence of advertising. In no particular order: slowing down or breaking web pages, trapping keyboard and mouse, obstructing the content, blinking or playing animations unstoppably, being disguised as real content, revealing hidden parts on hover or other unintentional gesture, and so on and so forth, plus all the tracking and stuffing and cloaking.</p>

<p><ins><strong>Update</strong>: Quartz just published a very compelling case against intrusive advertisements, saying that <a href="http://qz.com/412158/ad-blocking-software-has-figured-out-native-content-threatening-the-new-media-economy/">ad blockers are winning the race</a>. I guess you get what you deserve. I think the move to detect and block native advertising was a mistake though; while I don&rsquo;t consider native ads <em>in their current form</em> a good solution in the long run, sometimes you have to explore all avenues, and sometimes that means going too far.</ins></p>

<p>This may be inevitable, given the space advertising has been given from the outset, that advertisers resort to any device they have at hand to achieve their goals—after all, no one ever comes on a website for the purpose of experiencing its ads. And yet, it seems almost like a childish response to overdo it with countless layers of distracting effects.</p>

<p>(At this point, it would be unfair not to mention that there are great, ethical ads, which ultimately have a positive effect on their audience and the business’s bottom line.)</p>

<p>It is one thing to try to attract people’s attention, but taking away their freedom by preventing them to see or interact with the content is another. <strong>It’s no wonder users hate them.</strong></p>

<h3>They’re essentially Trojan horses</h3>

<p>It’s not very hard to understand that, once you allow a third-party to take control over the page, you believe that this third-party not mess with your most valuable asset: your audience’s trust.</p>

<p>Given how much care is taken to test and debug and continually integrate, how much an effort a team makes to deliver a smooth experience to everyone, only to realise it has been ruined by a 300 by 250 pixels image hosted elsewhere that takes seconds to load … <strong>It’s no wonder web developers hate them.</strong></p>

<h3>They’re a conflict of interest</h3>

<p>It’s worth mentioning once again that they practically work against the very thing they’re supposed to support. Even if people have developed effective <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banner_blindness">defence mechanisms</a>, the fact is that ads take precious seconds away from the carefully crafted content of the page.</p>

<p>In today’s day and age of ever-increasing notifications and <a href="http://www.nicholascarr.com/?page_id=16">superficial thinking</a>, a few seconds might make the difference and burn to the grounds the months of research, of writing, of editing and of designing that went into the creation of an article. <strong>It’s no wonder journalists hate them.</strong></p>

<h3>They’re using obsolete technology</h3>

<p>Flash is so last century. No, really. Forget smartwatches, smartphones and tablets. Forget desktop browsers where the plug-in is either absent or inactive—the first thing I do when I install a browser is to disable the Flash plug-in… pages load much faster plus I get rid of 80% ads.</p>

<p>Flash is a dying technology, at least on the Web. And yet, as if the situation wasn’t complicated enough, most advertisements are done in Flash.</p>

<hr>

<p>This situation is really unfortunate, given that online advertising may well be the only viable way to keep online publications afloat in the long run. While many smart people like <a href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/responsive-advertising">Mark Boulton</a> or <a href="http://rogerblack.com/blog/post/the_holy_grail_part_i">Roger Black</a> have explored the business implications of online advertising in a multi-device world, I find it perplexing that ads do not receive the attention they deserve on the design side. By their very purpose, they should be considered first-class citizens, just like content.</p>

<p>Surely, there must be ways to deliver ads that are not intrusive and yet manage to capture the user’s interest at the right time—a “welcome distraction for the eye,” as Mike Monteiro <a href="http://muledesign.com/2015/03/all-the-news-where-it-needs-to-fit">puts it</a>. Surely, we can find better solutions than the dull, bare design promulgated by niche networks like The Deck or Fusion Ads. By voluntarily cutting down on the effects, they improve the overall user experience, yes… but is this teeny tiny picture enough to imprint people’s memory? I doubt it.</p>

<p>Looking at the list above, I feel like the challenge is surmountable. Some people are already testing the waters. Examples that come to mind are the promising <a href="http://typecast.com/blog/mark-boulton-on-html-ads">responsive ads</a> demoed by Mark Boulton and his team at Monotype; or the delightfully immersive <a href="http://www.adtile.me/motion-ads/">motion ads</a> developed by Adtile. All are using standard technologies available in today’s browsers, on all platforms. And the list keeps growing: video tracks, WebGL, SVG, speech recognition, device orientation, you name it. There’s a whole universe of possibilities to explore here.</p>

<hr>

<p>Every year, thousands of people gather in theatres across the globe to attend the Night of the AdEaters, a five-hour long marathon spent watching TV commercials; is it too far-fetched to think that the Web could, too, boast high standards of multimedia, interactive advertising, and rally masses?</p>
