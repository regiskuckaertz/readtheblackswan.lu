        <p>TL;DR We need the local web design industry to raise its game if it wants to thrive in a global economy where DIY solutions are getting cheaper and better. This cannot be done without the help of design-focused associations like <a href="http://designfriends.lu">Design Friends</a>.</p>

<p><p><i>Because the topic is quite complex to articulate, I found myself flirting with the 3000 words threshold<a href="#fn-1"><sup id="sfn-1">1</sup></a> sooner than it takes to say “whoops a daisy” and ended up splitting the whole thing into two parts. And so, this is part one of an article on the state of the web design industry. Here, I’ll examine what is currently happening in the industry and explain why this represents a major turning point for local businesses. The second part will focus on figuring out potential ways for people working in the field to thrive in this shifting economy.</i></p>

<p>So, what’s going on?</p>

<hr>

<p>I was browsing the Web the other day, in search of something different from what I usually indulge myself with, when I discovered the brasserie Montefiore Sul Palco&rsquo;s <a href="http://montefiore.lu/">website</a>. Call it occupational hazard if you want, but more often than not, when I visit a website for the first time, I spend more time peering under the hood&mdash;inspecting the markup, styles and scripts&mdash;rather than looking at the rendered result itself. In fact, this happens only rarely when I visit local restaurants websites, because 99% of them look like crap and you can assume that, if what’s visible to everyone has been given so little care, then there is zero chance it’s going to be any better for those few who dabble in tag soup. But then here it was, the holy 1% that showed some love<a href="#fn-2"><sup id="sfn-2">2</sup></a>; the site that treated its content respectfully by giving it room to breathe and the graphical means to express itself; the site that featured carefully crafted photography supporting the text and neither of those DRM-free, meaningless smiling faces, nor those badly-cropped, dull shots that you see just about everywhere else; the site that actually invited visitors in. It wasn’t very hard to find out that it was powered by WordPress, with a <a href="http://themeforest.net/item/rosa-an-exquisite-restaurant-wordpress-theme/7920093">theme anyone can buy</a> for a couple of bucks, pretty much left untouched&mdash;a good sign this website was made by an amateur<a href="#fn-3"><sup id="sfn-3">3</sup></a>. Even the occasional discovery of a local website done with <em>taste</em> would&rsquo;ve gone completely forgotten by me, if it weren&rsquo;t for the fact that it was, supposedly, built without the help of a professional designer. Coincidentally, that event took me right in the middle of a streak of articles about the worrisome shift that is happening right now in the design industry. A shift that I fear will have dramatic consequences for local businesses here in Luxembourg&mdash;and if anything, Montefiore’s website shows it already began.</p>

<p>I’ve been ruminating on the state of the web industry in Luxembourg for quite a long time, haplessly complaining to those around me that it’s not making any real progress, that it’s all about imitation of trends&mdash;some of which are already old-fashioned&mdash;that nothing groundbreaking ever happens and that it still is considered as a toy by many people. There are so many issues that it’s hard to even know where to start. And it’s not like you have to look long and hard to find some examples. Just compare Montefiore’s website with household businesses’ like <a href="http://corporate.arcelormittal.com/">ArcelorMittal</a>, <a href="http://www.luxair.lu/">Luxair</a>, <a href="http://tango.lu/">Tango</a>, <del>or perhaps more strikingly, <a href="http://www.cactus.lu/fr">Cactus</a></del>. <ins>While I was researching for this article, Cactus’s website got a fresh coat of paint (admittedly, quite an undertaking and a great improvement compared to the horrible hodgepodge it used to be&mdash;and yet I can’t help but notice how strikingly similar browsing the website of Cactus is to browsing Montefiore’s; that sameness is a much more pervasive, vicious and difficult problem which is worth its own <a href="http://www.elischiff.com/blog/2015/4/21/fall-of-the-designer-part-iii-responsive-design">series</a> of <a href="https://medium.com/@intercom/has-visual-design-fallen-flat-a155cb6a5cda">articles</a>).</ins> The fact that these sites have different audiences and business goals is actually orthogonal from the argument that their design<a href="#fn-4"><sup id="sfn-4">4</sup></a> feels and looks extremely outdated, sluggish, repellent even.</p>

<p>It is this dissonance of a website that looks perfectly fine and was produced at a much lower budget than these presumably cost that makes me worry. Now, I’m not particularly concerned about these high-profile examples, their budget may very well be in the 99th percentile and we can all but hope they’ll follow the lead of Cactus. I also don&rsquo;t worry about the (rare) agencies who can actually sell Design; these practitioners know how to differentiate themselves from cheap, plug-and-play solutions&mdash;even of <a href="http://themeforest.net/">ThemeForest</a>’s quality-level. But what about all the others? The small and medium businesses that make up the vast majority of local web agencies’ hunting ground. What will they choose to do when they&rsquo;ll start to think about a possible redesign: hiring or going the Do-It-Yourself route?</p>

<h2>The commoditization of websites</h2>

<p>DIY solutions, even commercial ones, have existed ever since the Web has dynamic pages. Today, these products are not the emblem of cheap and dirty work they used to be; their quality has sky-rocketed. Championed by the likes of <a href="http://squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a>, <a href="http://virb.com/">Virb</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> or <a href="http://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a>&mdash;the so-called <strong>CMS as a Service</strong> product that can turn anyone into a website designer/developer&mdash;there are now a lot of affordable and great options a prospecting client can turn to. And these products are designed so well they make anyone who&rsquo;s looking at a regular CMS’s interface want to puke.</p>

<p>That in itself may be enough to convert many people, but of course the buck doesn’t stop there: the people behind these products have managed to put <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/feature-index/">a staggering amount of power</a> in the hands of their users. And that, dear reader, is the nail in the coffin. How much does it cost to hire someone and build the same thing from scratch? I guess now you see the point I’m trying to drive home. Chris Butler of North American agency Newfangled  <a href="https://www.newfangled.com/ad-agency-web-development-partner/">doesn&rsquo;t seem bothered</a> about softwares <i lang="fr">à la</i> Squarespace, but he hints at those who could be (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They’ve created software […] that makes customizing the basics of a website […] as easy as clicking a button or dragging and dropping something in place. What they’re offering is beyond satisfactory to those who couldn’t have done it for themselves — <mark>or paid someone else to do it for them</mark> — five years ago. If that is your client, then I suppose you should be afraid of Squarespace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How many business owners over here are willing to pay the high price when they can get something that is more than good enough for a fraction of it? Even if the trade-off is to lose some flexibility, I&rsquo;m betting the answer to that question is: not a lot. Indeed, for a market like ours, where the level of competition is usually very low, this makes perfect sense: there is hardly any incentive to go beyond the &ldquo;just enough.&rdquo; And with the rise in quality of these aforementioned products, that reasoning in the mind of a business owner would be quite understandable<a href="#fn-5"><sup id="sfn-5">5</sup></a>.</p>

<p>My line of thinking should be clear now: if, as a professional web designer, you can&rsquo;t differentiate yourself from DIY solutions and you can&rsquo;t <em>at the very least</em> do better than the pre-fabricated solutions offered by Squarespace et al, that means your services are a commodity&mdash;and your days are numbered.</p>

<p>The astute reader will notice two different problems emerge from there. One, many business owners do not recognize the true value of Design. Not that it&rsquo;s their fault; if this responsibility lies in anyone&rsquo;s hand, it is in those businesses’ whose job is to sell Design. But if this job isn&rsquo;t done well (or at all), then it&rsquo;s perfectly normal clients won&rsquo;t ever pay for it. Two, many local web professionals need to get up to speed with the knowledge, the tools and the techniques of Web Design&mdash;and User Experience in general&mdash;that can harness what the Web enables us to do today. Recall examples cited at the beginning of this article. Much has changed within the last ten years, but to say that is akin to stating a superficial tautology. What makes the Web unique is that it is constantly and rapidly changing; those who fail to embrace that change are eventually doomed.</p>

<p>These are challenges web professionals of Luxembourg <strong>must</strong> undertake, at the risk of seeing their clients taken away by DIY solutions&hellip; or smarter competitors.</p>

<h2>The slow demise of client services</h2>

<p>Despite the fact that they&rsquo;d probably argue the contrary, seeing and understanding the true value of Design is a rare characteristic of any business owner, one that few agencies have the chance to witness in their own clients. Too many times have I witnessed people confuse design with mere decoration, the painting of pretty pictures, instead of the driving force that can give them a substantial edge over their competition and ultimately boost their profits; I certainly am not alone in this.</p>

<p>Following this line of thought, it wouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise that web agencies are having a tough time getting new projects. And indeed, <a href="https://medium.com/@Brilliantcrank/the-future-of-the-digital-design-agency-in-the-united-states-f03f5c786276">they are</a>. Yet paradoxically, 2014 was a great year for Design&mdash;at least on paper. Many large corporations, like GE or IBM, started investing a lot in it. Alas, this money was not used to hire agencies’ services but instead served to set up their own teams, with the effect of gobbling up both large portions of the market and the pool of talents available for hire&mdash;sometimes going as far as eating away agencies&rsquo;s contingent.</p>

<p>In reaction to the acquisition of UX heavyweight <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/adaptive-path-where-were-going-next/">Adaptive Path</a> and the announcement of <a href="https://twitter.com/odannyboy/status/525672272749555712">Smart Design closing its doors</a>, co-founder of <abbr title=“Adaptive Path”>AP</abbr> Peter Merholz <a href="http://www.peterme.com/2014/10/24/san-francisco-design-agencies-feeling-the-squeeze/">explains</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What’s actually happening […] is that client’s <ins class="sic">sic</ins> willingness to buy design from agencies is decreasing, and project budgets have been shrinking. And the prevailing theory is that this is happening because companies are building in-house teams, and that’s where their ‘design budgets’ are going.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the year drew to a close, the founders of beloved agency Teehan+Lax <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/story/our-next-act">announced</a> they were moving to Facebook, as if to confirm what former nytimes.com design director Khoi Vinh <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2011/07/20/the-end-of-client-services/">anticipated back in 2011</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most critical time for designers to be involved in a digital product is <em>all the time</em>, but it’s perhaps most important for them to stick around after the launch, when they can see how a real user base is using it, and then amend, refine, revise and evolve it. But it’s at just about this time that most studios are preparing invoices and shuffling their staff on to other clients’ projects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The massive corporate takover happening right now on the other side of the ocean is at the same time <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/12/disappearing-business-of-design/">quite complex and fairly easy to make sense of</a>. But the question that should be on your lips is: is there any chance this will ever happen in Luxembourg?</p>

<p>By all accounts, even big firms in the financial sector have a digital agenda that is orders of magnitude less impressive than the Facebooks and IBMs of the world. This might very well change in the future, since the Luxembourg Government is betting high on digital as the backbone of a thriving economy, with the <a href="https://www.gouvernement.lu/4103901/20-digital-letzebuerg">recent launch</a> of its <i>Digital Lëtzebuerg</i> initiative. And so the question remains. Besides, the phenomenon has <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2015/03/the_death_of_the_agency_has_been_greatly/">already appeared</a> not far from here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The tech giants have started to reach their local hiring event horizon, which is one of the reasons they’ve started setting up outposts in London - to gather up all the local designers and developers they couldn’t (or wouldn’t necessarily want to) relocate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Andy Budd puts it, there are reasons to believe the death of client services has been over-exaggerated. But it is a cause for concern nonetheless, and one that should occupy the mind of everyone that has a stake in the business of Design.</p>

<hr>

<p>Slowly but surely, the market is eroding on both ends. With ads by Squarespace and The Grid popping up all over the place, the fact that these solutions exist and basically cost nothing at all won&rsquo;t take a long time before getting to small business owners’ ears. Factor in the emerging trend of building in-house teams and the local creative industry just got itself a pretty nasty situation. If this ever happens, some agencies in Luxembourg are going to be in deep&mdash;as in closing-their-doors-deep&mdash;trouble.</p>

<p>In the second part of this article, I&rsquo;ll explore what I think are worthy areas for limiting damage and how associations like Design Friends can help in this endeavour.</p>
