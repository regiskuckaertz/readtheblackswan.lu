> If what they're doing is sooooo great then why don't you go and work there, sucker?

That's my boss at the Web & UX office. It usually goes like this: Each day, I keep an eye on what's going on in the Web Design industry, making the rounds of a few hundreds blogs and magazines (who said RSS was dead?). Every now and then, I come across something that might be useful to improve our work at the government which I share with the team. The reaction is instantaneous, formulaic one might say.


Everyone thinks he's making fun of me, but of course I know he isn't[<sup id="sfn-1">1</sup>](#fn-1). Behind that questionable humour is a hidden layer of meaning, a conversation we've been having for a long time. And so a few weeks ago I gave the only reasonable answer I knew he was eventually expecting, semantically and syntactically fit according to our communication protocol:

> Well guess what, motherf#$%@r?!

I'm thrilled to announce that as of mid-November, I'll be joining the Commercial Dev team at [Guardian News and Media](http://www.theguardian.com/) as a front-end developer for advertising. <q>Whaaaaaaaaaat? Do you know the state the Advertising industry is in right now, like completely freaking out because of the ad-blocking hysteria that has taken the Internet by storm?</q> Yes, [advertising sucks](/thoughts/advertising-on-the-web/), but it doesn't have to. And that's precisely why it is---to me at least---one of the most fascinating challenge I could ever wish to tackle.

We're at this very interesting point in the history of the Internet where the idea of a useful, usable, seamless, fast website has gone mainstream. It's not just a bunch of geeks patting themselves on the back because they shaved 20ms off a page load time, it's everybody. User Experience is the new black. And so when you happen to learn that, first, the one thing that prevents websites from loading fast are the countless trackers installed in web pages to make (some) advertising work, and second, that there are ways to get rid of them and instantly save on your mobile data plan, your smartphone battery life and on page load times, usually the next thing you do is [give it a try](http://thenextweb.com/apple/2015/08/24/ios-9-content-blocking-will-transform-the-mobile-web-ive-tried-it/).

Alarmists would make you think that web advertising is dead, that the content blocking feature in the newly-released iOS 9 marks the end of it, but the reality is much more nuanced than that. Marco Arment best summarises it in his post outlining why he pulled out his own content blocker from the App Store:

> Ad blockers come with an important asterisk: while they do benefit a ton of people in major ways, they also hurt some, including many who don’t deserve the hit.

His app made no distinction between "good" and "bad" advertising, which on all accounts is throwing the baby with the bathwater. Cynics would say Arment was [shooting himself in the foot](https://twitter.com/gruber/status/644409410048106496) and withdrawing his app was the only reasonable choice he had, but whatever the reason on a fundamental level he's absolutely right: not all of advertising is at fault here. Issues with advertising reported the past few weeks either concern **privacy**, i.e. the bread-and-butter of a very specific---albeit very lucrative---part of the Advertising industry that's essentially based on [spying on you](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2015/08/12/separating-advertisings-wheat-and-chaff/), or **speed**, where a single page can contain [dozens of external widgets](http://blog.lmorchard.com/2015/07/22/the-verge-web-sucks/)[<sup id="sfn-2">2</sup>](#fn-2) and torpedo your experience of a website.

It would be easy to dismiss these as purely technical problems, but there are whole business models based around them, and so finding a solution will be more complicated than turn everything off and start from scratch. Besides, one must not forget that advertising is also what makes [the best journalism in the world](http://www.theguardian.com/) possible in the first place. What is at risk here is more than people losing their job---although at such a scale this is nothing but catastrophic---, it's our fundamental right to be active participants in a democracy; something that is ~~essential~~ [vital](http://fadeyev.net/the-role-of-the-press/) to the well-being of Society.

Online publishing has most certainly come at a crossroads and [will take a hit](http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/09/press-publish-16-jason-kint-on-how-worried-publishers-should-be-about-the-arrival-of-adblockers-on-mobile/) no matter what. But that kind of thing already happened in the past, it's the proverbial tipping point where an industry needs to reinvent itself. Says [David](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3944-disruption-is-better-when-its-other-peoples-jobs):

> The sooner you stop fighting the present, the sooner you can get to work on figuring out the future.

I recently had two choices: either I keep on building websites for people who don't really care or I join a team of people [at the top of their game](https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog) and tackle a problem that might change the face of a multi-billion dollar industry forever.
