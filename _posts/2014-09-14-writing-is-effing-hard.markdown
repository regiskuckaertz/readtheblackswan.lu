When I launched the Black Swan, I set myself a goal: I would write an article every month and progressively build up to a weekly publishing schedule. Then, using shorter, less narrative publishing formats, I’d reach the mythical output of *many times a day*. “That’s a hell of a plan,” I thought, and not particularly inconceivable. I mean look, they’re all doing it, right?


Needless to say, I’ve not succeeded. Little did I know about the efforts writing a journal requires. For the past several months,   I’ve been avoiding to look at my website, reluctantly using my computer for little administrative tasks, feigning to overlook the opened iA Writer window. The blinking blue cursor never stopped, I could’ve hit Command-Q and be done with it but a little voice in my head urged me to keep it open. I’m not giving up, quite the contrary in fact. This is a very good opportunity for me to sit and reflect on what happened, why it happened and make some changes to get back on rails.

## On the shoulders of giants

I read. Not a lot, I’m not a voracious book reader like my friend Cathy—who by the way [you should know](http://www.tulisquoi.net/)—but enough to keep me busy for several straight weeks, should I not leave the couch before finishing them all. Approximately half of my reading is on the Web about the Web—a daily task—the other half is a mixture of fiction, math and language. I read because I love the experience, the walls erected almost instantly all around myself when my whole world becomes a tiny piece of paper. Echoing what legions of readers have experienced for times immemorial, [Mandy Brown writes](http://alistapart.com/article/INDEFENSEOFREADERS):

> What each of these readers has in common is an ability to create solitude under circumstances that would seem to prohibit it. Reading is a necessarily solitary experience, like dying, everyone reads alone, but over the centuries readers have learned how to cultivate that solitude, how to grow it in the least hospitable environments. An experienced reader can lose herself in a good text with anything short of a war going on […], the horticultural equivalent of growing orchids in a desert.

It’s not hard to imagine myself consumed by a book, oblivious to my immediate surroundings, having lost the sense of time passing by—happens all the time. But reading is also a vehicle for learning how to write. That is [social psychology 101](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect), which David P. Gardner paraphrases well:

> We learn simply by the exposure of living. Much that passes for education is not education at all but ritual. The fact is that we are being educated when we know it least.

And I’m gonna posit that the same can be said about writing. I acknowledge that writing in english may look presumptuous from a french-speaking guy, but it wouldn’t even happen weren’t my readings almost exclusively in english. I regularly recognise after the fact that many sentences unconsciously reproduce something I previously registered. I guess not many authors would use the word ‘priming’ to describe their intended effect, but that’s what I feel is happening. Unfortunately, the gratifying discovery of the occasional well-written sentence comes at a price: I’m becoming extremely judgmental of my own writing. Let me summarise this: I read to teach me how to write, but the more I read the more I realise I can’t write. That’s a vicious form of procrastination, isn’t it?

I just need to get out of that circle, follow the words and see where they lead me. That’s what I realised recently, that this self-consciousness was but a self-inflicted pain, an unnecessary burden. Alas, the next hurdle came right off the bat.

## The commitment

Many renowned authors and artists have been pretty vocal about [the rituals they religiously followed](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/08/25/the-psychology-of-writing-daily-routine/) in order to put themselves in a state of creative flow: from standing position to surrounding objects, from alimentary regimens to strict social agendas, from sleeping patterns to daily schedules. No matter their particular preference, they all display the same kind of commitment. This may sound obvious, but writing does not happen between two episodes of Game of Thrones. In essence, any kind of creative activity requires a complete absence of distraction for a long-enough period of time. It’s not like I expected words to come out of the blue, but after a long day of work it’s hard to resist the temptation to switch into relaxation mode.

I need to make space for writing. Logistically speaking, perhaps I can think about ways to optimise my time; the sooner I get it done the sooner it’s out of the way, so to speak. Fortunately, this problem is far from new. I could use the wisdom of people who were there before me, couldn’t I?

Reflecting on the notion that we use objects to remind us of particular events of our past, Jack Cheng [wonders](http://alistapart.com/article/habit-fields) if we can’t train our mind to do the same for behaviours too:

> Here’s how I like to think about it: Every object emits a *habit field*. When we sit down at the desk in our office to work, we shape its habit field into a productive one. When we sit down in a lounge chair to watch our favorite TV program, we nudge the chair’s habit field toward relaxation and consumption. The more we repeat the same activity around an object, the stronger its habit field gets. And the stronger its habit field gets, the easier it is for us to effortlessly fall into that mode of behavior the next time we’re around the object.

There’s a chair in our apartment on which we rarely sit; it’s a bit off compared to the other pieces of furniture, I assume is why. I would never sit there normally, so perhaps I can use it to write, and write only; the more I use it, the more I shape its habit field and the easier it gets for me to write what I have in mind.

OK, so that’s basically the plan for now. There’s just one little detail…

## It’s the thinking, you stupid!

To whoever approached the idea of writing, sharing personal or fictional or work-related things, arrogance and narcissism—or perhaps self-consciousness—start to become a little more tangible. And yet, so many people are encouraging me to write—not me in particular, but me as a keyboard owner. [Merlin Mann](http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/169873399/clackity-noise):

> Please use that keyboard to talk about your life sometimes.
>
> Your real life. Not just the canned version of life on which we slap adhesive labels like happy or sad, poor or rich, employed or unemployed, “eating lunch” or “hatin’ life”, “it’s complicated” or “serial entrepreneur,” “meh” or “whatever.”
>
> Tear off your fucking labels.

I’m 1200 words into it and yes, I can tell, it all happened *on the run.* I just don’t want to fill the Web with 2000 words of boredom. I cannot help but see the writer/reader relationship as a kind of pact. Even more so in today’s oversaturated world; attention is a luxury that you must earn and pay the high price for. For the writer, it means sweating the details in every sentence, pouring oneself into the words so much that, when the writing’s done, he’s another person. Otherwise it’s stealing. And stealing people’s time makes me extremely uncomfortable. It’s not that I don’t have ideas or that I don’t know what to say. There are many drafts on my computer, sitting there silently until one day I eventually commit to work on them. In essence, *writing is easy, but being worth reading is a totally different beast.*

Online, there’s only a handful of authors that I revere. Oliver Reichenstein is one of them. This man knows how to give a reader his time’s worth, so when there’s a new piece on his site, I wait until I have enough time and space to process what he wrote, because I sure am in for a treat. This is part of the pact too. In this enthralling piece on the notion that quality needs deep, self-obliterating thinking, he [writes](http://ia.net/blog/putting-thought-into-things/):

> […] writing seems, romantically, a great occupation, until you sit down and ask yourself: what do I have to say? Once you start seriously listening, reflecting, and trying to use your imagination, you are willingly sitting down for slow, repetitive self-torture.

This sums it up well, as far as I’m concerned. Thinking is at the heart of every creative, artistic endeavour. And it’s fucking hard. This is almost revolting, but most of what happens to create something ends up being completely ignored or absent from the end product. And the opportunities to lose oneself are plenty, hence the need for constraints. I do think creativity and constraints are two sides of the same coin. For instance, take a newspaper, any newspaper. Look at it from a distance: see how there’s no gap, how the content and the paper match perfectly? This is something that you usually don’t notice while reading, precisely because it’s made so that everything looks like it’s falling naturally into place. Well, the truth is, it is not. Journalists are given very detailed rules on the length, the grammar, the punctuation and the style of a particular article. The by-product is that over time, they’ve developed creative ways to use language within these constraints, have become masters at saying things with as few words as necessary but not less.

You can see the vital role of constraints in just about every creative field. Some of them are obvious, tangible, like the size of the canvas for a painting; others are elusive, hardly noticed if ever, like the grid used for a magazine layout; others are completely impossible to notice, like a self-imposed limit of time to achieve something. I believe the 3 of them are necessary—vital. In fact, while it’s sometimes hard for the non-discerned eye to see the constraints at work, it’s far easier to  see when there were no constraints involved in the creation of something. Lousy products, ugly artworks, we notice them instantly without ever being able to put words on it, but we *feel* something is wrong, that the minds behind them lacked the motivation, the skills, or the will to make them good.

Now *that* is something I can work with. Given how many times I’ve drifted away without the confines of constraints, it may very well be the missing ingredient to get my writing going on.

Whether this modicum of observations will change anything is anyone’s guess, but I’m sure going to give it a go. We’ll see in a month.
