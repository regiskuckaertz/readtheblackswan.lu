I was so excited to [launch this thing](/oh-hello) that I forgot to introduce myself and let you know what this site is about. I'd better fix this right away so we can move on to more exciting stuff. First things first.


***

My name is Régis Kuckaertz and I'm a 34 year old front-end engineer living and working in Luxembourg. I work for [Nvision](http://nvision.lu) and two years ago I joined the Web & User Experience office of the Government, where we shape the future of its digital presence. That sounds boring, right? Well that's because it is. What you want to know is what I stand for in order to decide whether you like me or not. Here it goes:

I believe [writing markup is a craft](https://vimeo.com/34155414). HTML has by design a very low barrier to entry, but the fact is that it is hard to understand (even more to embrace) the tenets of semantic HTML. No, HTML is *not* [too complex](http://studiotendra.com/2014/01/29/html-is-too-complex/), but it takes years of practice before being able to create lean, semantic, efficient, fast, accessible, usable, attention-grabbing, [future-friendly](http://futurefriendlyweb.com/) and engaging websites. The same goes for CSS and JavaScript.

Even though I *love* learning and [sharing](https://www.readability.com/regiskuckaertz/) everything about web standards, I believe that the ultimate goal and therefore the only thing that matters in the end is to [create delightful experiences that trigger emotions](http://www.paris-web.fr/2012/conferences/tba.php). You may be the greatest designer of all time, turn every page into a masterpiece; if what people experience does not---at least---match their expectations, or help them achieve their goals, then it's completely useless. Nobody will care about your responsive grid if it doesn't save people's lives.

I believe the web in Luxembourg is as crappy a place as one can find when it comes to practicing with ethics, care and passion. Go and have a look at it, I'll be waiting right here. See? The number of things going wrong is such, it is hard to decide where to start. I've been there so many times. User research? Lol, we don't need any research---we know everything there is to know already. The content? Don't worry about it, we have a brochure we spent too much money on---better use it twice. Oh, by the way, let's put a big ad over there, juuuuust above what people are looking for so they can't ignore it---advertisers will believe it's worth their money. Our budget? It works the other way, pal: you tell us how much it costs based on this unrealistic project description and then *we* decide if we want it or not. I could go on and on. While agencies are still catching up with concepts such as semantic markup, grids and typography for the web, the DOM, progressive enhancement, responsive design, ... the true challenges remain to be tackled: where are the great narratives? The dazzling stories that move people? The mixture of texts, images, sounds and videos crafted with so much care and precision that they cause emotions? The [little big details](http://littlebigdetails.com/) that turn businesses into religions? That sounds depressing, but it's not. In fact, that's why it is so rewarding to work there---even a small dent in this insurmountable pile of crap can make you feel like you are doing the right thing.

I believe people are responsible for where they end up, in every part of life and especially at work. *You* are the one in charge of finding an environment where your skills are valued, challenged and renewed. If you think others will take care of this for you, or if anyone told you they would, you are as misguided as they are. For if there's anything that matters at any time, it's that you have everything to prove. [You get what you deserve](http://designprofessionalism.com/defining-design-professionalism-1.php), but don't take my word for it. Have a look around and ask yourself these questions: Do you love working with them? Are they getting the best out of you? Do they exceed your expectations? Are you proud of what you're doing? Do they match your ethical standards?

I believe creativity is not the privilege of a chosen few but a skill that *anyone in any field* must train and nurture in order to be recognised as a valued personality, capable of achieving outstanding things and recognise opportunities where everyone else sees banality. I get incredibly angry at those who try to convince others and themselves otherwise. They are a danger to themselves and the people depending on them. It is both infuriating and sad to see potential talent completely wasted, meet someone---who could otherwise have been a champion of creativity---lost on arrogance, elitism and close-mindedness.

Can you relate to that? If yes, that's incredible---[we should talk](http://twitter.com/regiskuckaertz). If not, there's a chance we might not get along, but I'm willing to try nonetheless. Because, as an avid reader of things totally unrelated from the World Wide Web, I find inspiration in the fickle connections one can draw out of accidental discoveries. There's a great idea waiting around the corner, all it needs is the [cross-pollination of knowledge](http://www.brainpickings.org/) that happens when people meet, share and debate. Let's do this.

## Ok that's great and all but, what's with the name?

As mentioned above, I work in a country where the web is really undervalued compared to other, more traditional, mediums. It just isn't taken seriously enough, to a point where [it's a joke](http://www.media-awards.lu/media-awards_Internet.27-2.html) to see how abysmal the quality of awarded websites is---needless to say how ridiculed they would be, should one ever try to go for [the big league](https://thenetawards.com/). It's like fifteen years ago elsewhere; only it's today here. Where this comes from is hard to pinpoint, but I kind of feel there are several elements at play here---most of which I'll write about at length in the near future.

Our industry needs to be shaken up if it wants to advance to a point where it's on par with current standards and get some attention. This site is my attempt at doing so. It's name is a bold and presumptuous reference to the [black swan theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory):

> The black swan theory [...] is a metaphor that describes an event that comes as a surprise, has a major effect, and is often inappropriately rationalized after the fact with the benefit of hindsight.

That was bound to happen.
