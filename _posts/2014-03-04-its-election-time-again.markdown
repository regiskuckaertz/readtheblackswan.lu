**Update March 17**: Something interesting happened today. On March 4th, I wrote this post in order to explain some of the work that went into the making of the new elections.lu; later on, ITnation published [an article](http://www.itnation.lu/news/elections-lu-rouvre-sa-plateforme-pour-les-elections-europeennes/30657/) on the upcoming "responsive platform" (whatever that means) elections.lu, linking to this very post for more details on the matter. Although I was kind of happy the word on my writings spread so fast, I quickly realised  I was disclosing information that did not belong to me, something that could mislead people into thinking I spoke for the Centre des Technologies de l'Information. Obviously, that was unintentional. I cannot stress enough that the site elections.lu is the result of a coordinated effort between many teams, of which I am proud to be a part of.

To edit this post out of any reference to the work itself would alter its meaning to the point of ridicule, I therefore decided to take the whole thing down in order to prevent any further confusion. This does not mean I won't cover every technique I've developed recently in details on this site---I will. There are many things, some I brushed over, some I didn't mention, that would benefit from in-depth explanations.

This little stunt has at least the merit of unearthing one of Luxembourg Web scene's greatest irony: that for a medium that is the ultimate communication tool, there's an utter lack of communication happening on the web, about the web. *Un*communication, as I've started to call it, may very well be *the* reason why many websites that see the light of day look amateurish at best when looked at under the microscope of modern web design. This is a complex topic, one that finds its roots in the cultural landscape of Luxembourg; one that's going to be fun to examine in a future post.
