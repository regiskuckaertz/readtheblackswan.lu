On October 23rd, I had the honour of speaking at the [tenth alumni convention](http://www.sae-alumni-convention.org/) of the School of Audio Engineering in Berlin.


The idea of sharing to a younger audience what I’ve learned along the way has been one of the rationales behind this journal, and thus I used this opportunity to talk about things that would’ve eventually ended up as long-form articles here. Surprisingly, perhaps half the audience were not alumni—heck, they had not even started their studies—something I really hadn’t foreseen.

Public speaking is one of those things I find both frightening and exciting. As a regular audience attendee, I have come to expect a lot from public speakers; that they challenge my current thinking, that they make me want to learn new things, that they do not bore me. I tried to set the same standards to myself, although whether I succeeded is anyone’s guess.

You’re probably wondering why this title. Oh dear. Well, it’s an unfortunate turn of events: I had just settled on the subject “what would I say to my 18-year old self?” when one day I found myself in dire need of turning my brains off and came across [this movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1231587/). I really wished there was more to it, but no.

So, without further ado, here’s the script of the talk I gave, along with a few side notes for additional background.

## Don’t trust me

I would like to start with a huge disclaimer. Do not trust me, or anyone you listen to, or read. And by that I don’t mean that you shouldn’t pay attention. Quite the opposite in fact. Do it, to your heart’s content. Just don’t use it as an excuse to not do the things by yourself.

In fact, make a rule to yourself to open your ears as much as possible, listen to the same subject covered by different people with various backgrounds, different perspectives. Compare those points of views. See where they agree and where they differ. Spot the contradictions, there are always contradictions. Make up your own opinion. The more you’ll do that, the more you’ll understand that for many problems there is an infinite number of solutions, that many of them are neither good nor bad but may just work in a particular context.

Just come up with ideas of your own. People who barely reap the fruits of others’ labour all have one thing in common: their work is lifeless, without stamina. Like a movie where excessive special effects try to provide for the lack of gravitas in the actors’ play. And that sucks, it’s a waste of everybody’s time. Oh I’m sure you’ll steal. I do, every day. But at least steal like an artist. Consider for a moment that some of the best writers learned to write by writing, word for word, the works of the authors they revered. Stealing is a part of the process, not the end of it.

Remix. It won’t be long before you understand that to come up with a good solution means failing and failing often. Beware emotional attachment. Ideas are not your children, nor your pets. More importantly, they are not you. You should be able to toss them out without hesitation, start from scratch as often as necessary. For you are makers and for people like you it’s the journey that counts, not the destination.

Fortunately for me, for you, most of what you’ll hear today, you’ll forget. I can give you the best advice in the world, you’re not going to stick to it. Which is the whole point, paradoxically. The great thing about events like this one is not that you get to meet other people like you and pat yourself on the back for being so awesome, but that you can’t wait to get back home and fire up Photoshop and start doing this thing that’s been itching you ever since you heard this speaker talk about that and this other one mention another thing and you suddenly had this epiphany about reconciling the two and now it’s been growing inside of you it’s unbearable you must get it out but you don’t want to talk about it because it’s beyond words *you have to do it*.

*That* is what I’m talking about.

## You have everything to prove

So you just graduated from college and now you’re entering the job market, ready to prove the world how awesome you are. Only you’re probably not equipped to do so. Let’s put aside the fact that there is virtually no school that prepares you for what it is to get up every day and work for a living; that you’ll have to deal with a shit list of things that are not strictly related to what you’re paid to do; that sometimes personal issues will impede your ability to work but you’ll have to do it anyway; or that you don’t have any real world experience of what work is in the first place.

As far as work is concerned, you’re a clean slate, a blank sheet of paper. This is day zero for you. Now I don’t mean no disrespect, so please don’t take offence when I say that *you are nobody*. You’re not special, not smarter, not the one everyone was expecting.

Abandon any such feelings right now, for your own sake and for other’s.

Because if you don’t whatever you’ll ultimately turn into is so disconnected from what others are seeing (i.e. the reality) you won’t have any idea how blind you are. Now if this looks diminishing to you, hold on because it gets better. The grapes of greatness are inside of you; they’re inside of anybody. All it takes for them to grow is for you to realise that your ego is the only roadblock to becoming someone. Written like that makes it sound simple, it’s actually one of the hardest thing you’ll ever have to do, because said ego will relentlessly come back in various forms to haunt you and expelling it is going to be a constant struggle. One that will require your whole attention. There are times where you’ll succeed, others you won’t.

The moment I realised this was that kind of moment where you have the impression something was buried deep inside of you, something you knew all along but you didn’t know you knew. That feeling is very difficult to express, but you know it’s the Truth. A truth so overwhelming, so transcending, that you wouldn’t even dare to question it.

And this truth is that it’s not a lack of money, or resources, or your boss, or you client, that prevents you from being great: it’s yourself. So yes, perhaps right now, you are no one, but the good news is you aspire to be. There is another you, waiting to be discovered. When you see it like that, you embark on a lifelong journey that, for all the efforts it will require, is paved with exceptionally rewarding treasures. That I can promise you. And it doesn’t matter if you don’t know how to do it—or even who you want to be. It’s not like you even have to think about it. Because of the others. People will expect from you nothing less than you’re very best, and that is the trigger you need to pull. It doesn’t matter either that you don’t know what “your very best” actually is. You’ll figure it out on the way.

## The entropy of life

As a corollary, there are chances you’ll end up doing something that is at odds with what you studied at school. And by that I really mean you’ll have the feeling you lost your time all those years.

That used to be different. In the past, when you made a choice, you were pretty much stuck with it and had to endure all the consequences of a potentially bad choice (perhaps imposed on you). But now, things are different, the rules have shifted gears. We have the choice to change our mind, and to do it often.

Choice might not be the best word here, because it implies conscious, deliberate action on your behalf, which I think is not exactly what is going to happen. Something that you can find beautiful or sad depending on how you choose to see it, is that you have little actual control over who you’ll become. That person, that other you, mainly depends on external factors you can’t predict at all will happen.

Talking about this reminds me of this great story related by Sir Ken Robinson, about that little girl who was completely hopeless at school, who today would have been diagnosed with ADHD or some other bullshit condition, but who eventually became a billionaire choreographer. And it wouldn’t probably have ended up like that, hadn’t the school written to her parents, hadn’t her parents brought her to a doctor—that doctor among dozens of other doctors—hadn’t that doctor had the idea to observe her and who understood and who showed her parents that this little girl couldn’t stop dancing when she was hearing music and whose only prescription was: bring her to a dance school. What an unlikely series of events, isn’t it? It’s not hard to imagine that she wouldn’t be where she is today had one small detail been different.

Now this is an extreme example. I’m not saying that all children with problems at school are would-be billionaires, otherwise we would all be pretending, right? Let’s get back to us. What is our turn of events? The most likely answer to that question is: we don’t know, or at least we won’t until we get there. I like to see my path in life as a series of ricochets, each one being correlated with the previous one but under a number of conditions so unbelievably high that’s it’s humanly impossible to predict where the next one will lead me. And yes to some degree this is frightening, but it’s also wonderful. Even if we all dress the same, publish the same stupid things on Facebook, watch the same movies, reproduce exactly the same patterns, each one of us is truly unique by virtue of all these ricochets. So at this point if you’re afraid you won’t become who you want to be, let me spare you the wait: you won’t. You’ll be much more interesting than that, much more complex and nuanced than this little reductive insignificant picture you have in mind. And if you are worried, my advice is that you stop right now, because the time you spend thinking about it is the time you don’t spend living it.

And **living is where all the opportunities come from**, I guess we can all agree on that.

## You know nothing

<aside class="aside">
	<p>I have a thing for dramatic titles.</p>
</aside>

There is something that nobody tells you at school, it is that all the studying you did to pass these exams, all these nights awake trying to figure out what the hell this is all about, and that now you’re looking at with a bit of nostalgia or perhaps some bitterness; all this learning is in fact *nothing* compared to what you’ll have to learn if you want to succeed.

I’m speaking strictly about the web here, which is the industry I have been in for a decade and the only one I can speak of with some kind of authority, but I’m sure this is true for all the other industries. You must evolve your knowledge at the same pace as the Web does, i.e. very fast. Follow this rule to the letter for as long as you can. That is the only way I found out that works—if you want to thrive. Always be on the lookout for the things you don’t know yet. And don’t worry, the web is an unquenchable source. Just look at the browser release cycles alone: there’s a new version coming out every 6 weeks or so, each one giving developers and designers access to more APIs, more CSS modules, more HTML elements and attributes, introducing new file formats, new protocols, new diagnostic and testing tools. Even the standardisation process is happening faster than it used to now that all browser makers have rallied under the web standards banner. The web has finally gained momentum, and it’s going to keep accelerating. Every day, there is a new technique to learn, a new language to master, a tool to pre-process, another tool to post-process. Plus there are all the other areas that, because the web is a communication platform, you may need to know depending on what you aspire to do: social psychology, motion design, typography, cognitive psychology, ergonomics, information architecture, animation, information theory, semiotics, writing, colour theory, rhetoric, anthropology, … the list goes on and on. And don’t get me started on hardware. Screens of all sizes, wearables, sensors, seams, CPUs, GPUs, beacons. Even the humble hand. Factor in Moore’s law and it becomes nightmarish.

If you’re like me you’ll want to know everything, and eventually be disillusioned with your capacity to learn. For many years I have been haunted by a vision. I’m right in the middle of an ocean, swimming; no matter where I look, there’s no sign of land anywhere; it’s impossible for me to know in which direction to go. Talk about anxiety. I’ve come to grips with it eventually, as I’m sure you will too. Nevertheless, the lesson remains: it will probably be a long time before you know more than enough, either by the industry’s standards or by the ones you set yourself.

This is what you shouldn’t forget: **The web is the fucking Renaissance, man**!

## Fear the exhaustion

<aside class="aside">
	<p>I wrote this because I was a bit disappointed that close to nothing was written on a subject as real and urgent as burnout. Aside from <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/burnout">this great article by Scott Boms</a> (five years ago!), the subject is glaringly missing coverage.</p>
	<p>Somewhat unexpectedly, the last few weeks have seen many people being pretty vocal on mental health issues and how to cope with them. Hell, it’s even been given a name and a proper home: <a href="http://geekmentalhelp.com/">Mental Help Week</a>.</p>
	<p>It must be said that nothing I wrote here comes even close to what these people shared; I cannot state more that that thing inside of you that makes you a great human being/professional is fragile and delicate and <em>must be taken care of</em>. I urge you to go and have a look at this website.</p>
</aside>

Everything’s not all peaches and cream. If you don’t pay attention, that thirst for knowledge, a job that is always on by nature and therefore breaks the barriers you try to create between your professional and personal lives, … well, I’m sorry to say it won’t last if you don’t have a minimum of hygiene. When you’re keeping your nose to the grindstone, it’s easy to get lost and not notice that little monster, lurking in the dark. The first signs are barely noticeable, so inconspicuous you won’t be able to make the connection. A bad night’s sleep, your neck stiff, fidgeting, being withdrawn. The kind of thing you can manage. I mean it’s nothing, you’re part of something much bigger, it’s the web after all! You just need a coffee.

Soon enough, the signs will occur more and more, getting stronger, day after day after day, eating up your motivation bit by bit. Suddenly you’ll start to wonder what you’ve done all this time and you won’t find any answer you can be proud of. You’ll feel wasted, useless, exhausted. Unable to focus on anything. Once you’re on the web, totally committed, it’s very easy to get lost, forget where you came from and, more importantly, where you’re heading.

It’s a proven fact that even a very small exposure to the web, as in just a few hours, is enough to rewire your internal circuitry. A number of studies have shown that our online activity turns us into superficial, shallow thinkers who are very easily distracted. It turns out that the mere act of seeing a hyperlink disrupts our concentration and therefore weakens our ability to learn.

If you’re not freaking out right now, I don’t know what will. For all the good things the Web brought to us, there’s an equal amount of signs it can actually be bad for our health. In 2012, Simon Collison gave a talk at CreativeMornings in New York where he laments about the increasing amount of knowledge that today’s web designers must accumulate if they want to be called web designers in the first place, and beautifully addresses the paradox of exposing to a community who, let’s be honest, thinks of itself as a bunch of superheroes, just how human and limited we all are. He says:

> Whether you’ll agree with everything I’ll say, whether you’ll like what I'll say, I’m not sure. But at the very least I thought I could come here and kind of bear something off myself and just let you know how I feel. I think sometimes there’s a perception that some designers are on top of everything. I’m not.

There’s not much to add to it, is there? It seems like a plague of our western culture that we tend to mistake quantity for quality. Somewhere deep inside us, *a notion reinforced by generations of post-industrial revolution education makes us think that more is always better*. It’s visceral and horrifyingly pervasive: our quality of life, our success, is measured in numbers. We just can’t resist it. And of course it’s completely wrong. The proofs are there by the thousands, and they’re all backed by science and spirituality.

Here is a plea from me to you: take as much care about your mental and physical health as you take care of your knowledge. Get away from the constant noise of the web. There are many activities out there to cover for what the web does to your brain. Your life and ultimately the life of the people around you depend on it.

<aside class="aside">
	<p>I was holding my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Consider-Lobster-Essays-Foster-Wallace/dp/0316013323"><b>Consider the Lobster</b></a>, of all the books I have this one in particular was perhaps the best I could’ve chosen.</p>
</aside>

This is a book, a door to the most dazzling journeys you’ll ever make. You like drawing? Painting? Street art? Photography? Pottery? Mechanics? DJ-ing? Playing an instrument? Woodworking? Letterpress? Leather craft? T-shirt printing? 3D printing? Get your hands dirty. You like sports? Get out and sweat your heart out. You like cooking? Fishing? Hunting? Wine tasting? Cigar smoking? Whatever your thing is, do it and do it thoroughly. Understand the underlying principles, learn to see the components and how they play together. Learn the fucking history of it.

Because you see, there is another nasty side effect to insulating yourself from the outside. You become boring, obsolete, washed-out. A facsimile. Unable to come up with anything that hasn’t already been done and redone. A slave to your limited, recycled spirit. I’ve seen it happen and chances are you will too. It’s not funny.

However, if you “choose the red pill,” very good things will happen. Because the mind is a phenomenal device, you’ll start to make connections between things that were completely distant from one another, these connections will lead to yet other connections, you’ll have thoughts and ideas you would never have had on your own, these ideas will nurture everything you do and yes, in case you were wondering, your work too.

And this is what will make you truly unique, these connections.

## Don’t work with idiots

Right now I’m in a comfortable position, I have been doing this for more than 10 years so it’s kind of hard for me to imagine your situation. But I interviewed people on several occasions, and from this vantage point it’s always baffling to see how unprepared they all are.

If you look at it from a distance, it’s easy to see the interview as a kind of natural selection process, where only the fittest survives. Of course the interviewer loves this because it puts her in the comfortable position of being the one who gets to decide, who “makes you an offer.” But it turns out, this vision is not only inadequate, it’s outright dangerous. Nobody said the roles were fixed, and it’s easy to understand why. After all, it’s called “finding a job” for a reason. At some point it’s on you to take turn and ask for the part where you get to know whether you’ll be happy there or not, where you get to choose if you want to spend the majority of your time over there. Because if you sign that piece of paper, this is what’s going to happen. And believe me, any financial incentive will be worth nothing if you feel like shit having to get up everyday to join a bunch of assholes for at least 8 hours a day.

So, while the temptation to accept anything that comes your way is huge, I urge you to resist and think. I mean sure, there will probably be a trial period and you can leave whenever you want, but signing a contract is a commitment nonetheless, and you must take it seriously.

What kind of impression do you think you’ll make if you go from trial period to trial period, little grasshopper?

Now is your chance, seize it. Be curious about the company’s culture. Grab any information that comes your way, either by asking questions, meeting the people who work there. Look at the kind of clients they have, the kind of work they do: this is in direct correlation with who they are. In today’s world where everything has a social network, it would be surprising the company has no social activity. So go have a look. Perhaps if they don’t, it should be a red light for you.

And yes, it’s more important to get to know the employees of a company rather than the head of HR, the director, or even your boss. It is them who shape the company’s culture, them who will have to welcome you inside a probably already functioning microcosm, them who you’ll have to turn to because you don’t know what is what, them with whom you’ll spend most of your time. After all, places where you go to work are often called “company,” which I suggest to you is not an accidental term.

## Don’t work for idiots

Of course you get to choose who you work for too. When you’re in the middle of an interview, you tend to forget that aspect and get lost in the conversation. Which is bad of course, because what you’re talking about is a potential future relationship. And to some degree, this is no different from the relationship you have, with your friends, your boy- or girlfriend: if you want it to work, both of you must agree on a set of rules by which your relationship abides. That means you also get to decide what those rules are, and what you’ll both trade off in this mutual agreement.

If it helps, I’d ask think of it this way: just like any story, your job will have a beginning, a middle and an end.

At the beginning, the responsibilities lie more on the side of the company you work for. You have a lot to get accustomed to: the company’s culture, the workflows, the hardware, the software, how you’ll fit in. What do they plan to do to put you on good grounds?

Then think about your life in the company. It won’t be linear, monotonic, and certainly not smooth. Just like in any relationship, there will be highs and lows. But you both have high expectations, they hope you’ll fuel the company with your creativity and you should also have the ambition to grow a better whatever-your-title-is and excel at what you do.

And eventually yes, you will have to put an end to that relationship. It may be because you retire, or because you want to take another challenge, or because your relationship turned out to be unsustainable. But it will happen.

I know it’s a lot, but it’s basically what the content of that contract represents. The company is an environment where you will grow, learn new things, let your personality evolve, increase your experience, create. This is the real value you get out of that contract: it’s the whole journey. So when you sign that piece of paper, what you really are giving in exchange of money is your future self, who you become at the end.

So my advice is you’d better make sure you can trust them to provide a challenging and rewarding environment for the life you’re going to live inside of their walls.

## Learn to say fuck off

When you sign that contract, you’re in for the long haul. And by that, I mean that you promised you will do your best to make that relationship work for a very long time. I say that because I find certain people have it too easy and when the first real problems arise, they just quit. “Goodbye and go fuck yourself.” Or, they just follow the money and quit when an juicier offer comes up, with no hesitation.

There's a company I know very well that refuses to put names and photos on its website because they fear other companies will then try to steal employees from them. This is beyond ridiculous, right? Because in the end, a company’s worth is nothing more than what its human collective is able to deliver, so why the hell aren’t its leaders doing everything they can to show the world how much they care about their employees and acknowledge their contribution to the company? I mean if you expect loyalty from your crew, you should at least give them a reason to be loyal in the first place. Because obviously money does not buy loyalty, it never did. Of course that’s some vicious circle, as it does not encourage people to come for anything else than cash. The kind of people who will succumb to that way of dealing with their career, jumping from one host to another, feeding on them and then leaving, I think there’s a name for that: parasites. And to think that there are companies willing to employ those parasites, this says a lot about their definition of professionalism and probably also the way they treat clients. I still can’t wrap my head around that, even after seeing it happen for real.

I’ve been working for 10 years for the same company, and I can tell you it’s not been easy. I’ve been disappointed many times, they have too. It took a lot of time and effort before we finally figured it out, before we found the best way for us to get the most out of our relationship. And I had many opportunities to quit, either by starting my own thing or leaving for another company. It’s not that I blatantly refuse these potential outcomes, I still think about them regularly. But there’s a right way and a right time to do that, i.e. if you aspire to becoming a professional and a respected human being, well then you must show some respect.

Besides, the guy who’s trying to win you using unethical tactics, well he *is* an idiot, so why work for him?

So when I say “learn to say fuck off,” it means that you really have to get your acts together before making a decision. It also means that you know the kind of impression you’ll make and the kind of work you’ll get when you do it.

## The Spoils of Creativity

A thing or two you need to know about creativity. Now at this point if you’re expecting I'm going to tell you that you’re not creative, I’m sorry. I really have to work on my titles. Of course I won’t say that.

<aside class="aside">
	<p>If you want to go down the rabbit hole, I heartily recommend a daily dose of <a href="http://brainpickings.org/">Brain Pickings</a>, it cannot hurt.</p>
</aside>

Creativity. Oh I hate that word. Not because of the what or the why. Defining creativity? A concept so elusive and ethereal that it occupied generations of philosophers, scientists and artists. This is way beyond my abilities. But I know enough to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff. And so what I want to talk about is all the bullshit creativity carries with it, the kind of thing you will probably be confronted with if you end up working in the so-called creative industry. Which I assume you will, as that was the whole point of your college education.

I’m about to open a can of worms which, once again, lies in our myopic, short-sighted view of the world. In particular, I’m referring to our compulsive need to put people inside boxes, and the dangers that come with it. No matter what your area of expertise is, it’s quite common to differentiate people based on their role. For instance, on the web we usually have developers, designers, copywriters, community managers, … Of course that kind of discrimination can make you smile, when you know how even areas of expertise so dissimilar can share many aspects when looked at from a certain distance. But let’s assume for a while that it is a valid and reasonable way of seeing things. Trouble starts when people mistake these boxes with quality values, like “these ones are great for blablabla while these ones not so much,” because sooner or later the label “creative” will be thrown into the mix, and some will be called “the creatives” while the others will be called … well, they won’t be called anything because you know, the point is not to diminish them, because quote, “it’s just that they’re not that type of person.”

<aside class="aside">
	<p>I’m not the first one to <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/web/creatives/">call bullshit on the word “creative”</a>.</p>
</aside>

Now if you’re like me, you’ve never liked being called something. Most of the times it’s because of the corresponding stereotypes, other times it’s because of what implicitly you are not. I mean we are complex human beings, nuanced in many subtle ways, it’s impossible to abstract us to a single word, is it? And my experience is that, when it comes to this label, creative, it means things have reached a tipping point and what’s coming up is bound to be bad for everyone, no matter on which side of the creative/non-creative dichotomy you reside.

Let’s first get rid of that ludicrous idea that some people are creative while others are not. Not only is the thing insulting, it also does not resist the most basic examination. Take a look at your school’s program: where are the classes that “teach” you creativity? Lateral thinking perhaps? Transformative learning? Synectics? Improvisation? The last time I remember having a teacher trying to stimulate my creativity, I was in elementary school. Take a look at the literature of any creative field: advertising, architecture, design, music, games, … I still have to find a book where creativity is singled out as something you were born with.

No, the label “creative” was invented by people who try to impose their shallow, limited view of the world on others. They may have no bad motive at all, but their social status or apparent self-confidence makes them think they know what they’re talking about. Meaning, they know better than you. Oh really, that’s cute. If you want to know how dangerous this idea is and what kind of damaging consequences it can have, I’ll ask you to remember this video that made the rounds of the Internet a few months ago, of a bunch of African soldiers who make fun of a small chimp and give him a rifle, which eventually the chimp fires against the soldiers and perhaps hurt or kill someone in the process. Yes, I know it was a fake, but you get the idea.

Be tagged a creative person, you will end up being a fraud, unable to question your own judgment. Be tagged a non-creative person, you will end up doing nothing but procedural, automatic, information processing. Let this idea sink in, and watch a group of people who could have created wonderful things become divisive, doing everything to please their peers and put the blame on the others. That’s right, at this point it’s probably too late, the company’s culture is rotten and will eventually kill every newcomer’s good intentions.

So if it’s not clear right now, this is an example where you can say fuck off.

Every now and then I tend to lose track of what really matters. That’s a very bad habit which I try to get rid of with all sorts of tricks, but it keeps coming back since I started my professional life. It’s not always easy to accept the truth, but the fact is that being too much involved into something can cost you a lot.

What does really matter? I mean eventually everyone has to come up with an answer to that question, right? For a second, I want you to think about your life; think about the things you did, the bad stuff and the good stuff; think about your loved ones, family and friends, the people you hate too; think about the places you went, the food you tasted; think about that book that changed your life altogether because you bonded with the author who had the very same ideas as yours only much earlier and with much much more insight; or that concert where you were shirtless because it was so hot and then suddenly it started raining but there were so many people around you it was not possible for you to put that t-shirt on but you didn’t care ’cause it was one of those magical moments where you feel like everything is coming together nicely, the music, the weather, and you feel like you’re part of something bigger and it’s great; think about that night you were sitting next to your girlfriend and then suddenly she put her hand on yours, and it was nothing special just an automatic everyday gesture, but you stared at her hand and in an instant you could see the thousand times your hands touched, all of them, and you longed to see the thousands, millions of times your hands will touch again in the future, and you feel so lucky; think about all the things still waiting to be done, waiting to be learned, all the experiences waiting to be lived, and how just the thought of it gives you the energy of a tiger and you cannot wait for tomorrow to come. All these things, these millions and then more of little, huge, things that add up to make what you are now. I don’t know you, but knowing that I am so many of these things, all with their own wonderful, infinite complexity, makes me able to see life with a bit of perspective.

I want to leave you on this final note: no matter how much you’ve invested of yourself into it, no matter how much you identify with it, this is just a job, a tiny piece of the puzzle.

Thank you
