I know, I know. But I can explain.

***

This post marks my one year anniversary at [*The Guardian*](http://gu.com)—Yay! Not coincidentally, it is also the time this journal has been lying dormant—Boo! I know it will sound cliché but I’m going to say it anyway: I haven’t seen time pass by. This is a good thing, right?

Looking back, many reasons come to mind as to why I stayed under the radar for so long, and in this post I’d like to try and unpack all of them. Ok, where should I start? Why, one year ago sounds like as good a pick as any.

## To London and back

However excited I was to start a new career, the feeling that would probably describe these new beginnings most closely would be one of void. While I gladly left a country that barely if ever provided any gratifying intellectual challenge, my heart sank as I kissed my better half goodbye for the very first time at the airport. I think I speak for the both of us when I say we had absolutely no idea how our relationship would be affected. We both knew this wouldn’t be easy, of course. As I was going through the interview process and the likelihood of getting the job was growing, we became even more aware of the bond between us and how strong our mutual love was. When the news came—no pun intended—we had three months of build up in front of us, more than enough to contemplate our future and draw all sorts of conjectures. In hindsight, I think we managed it, and the months that came after, perfectly.

First, we decided to form a civil partnership. It is hard to put into words, but there are moments in life when decisions seem to come from very deep inside of you, it is tempting to taint them with mysticism---something [along those lines](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/61926-thermodynamic-miracles-events-with-odds-against-so-astronomical-they-re-effectively). It was a no-brainer and it felt extremely good.

Second, we would visit each other regularly during weekends. Fortunately for us, Luxembourg–London is covered by several airlines, so much so that even Luxair’s terrible pricing strategy is not an impediment. We quickly settled on a fortnightly rhythm and, even though a weekend goes by really fast—or perhaps because of that—it is enough for us to “recharge batteries.” Thirdly, we would call each other every day and share our day’s worth of gossip. In all honesty, I do not look forward to hearing about the buffoons that populate the CTIE (her and my former workplace) and the countless imaginative ways they manage to do *nothing interesting*, but I couldn’t spend a day without seeing her face. My life would be in danger if I also didn’t mention our cat Moustique, alias [Agent Krouchnov](https://www.facebook.com/krouchnov/), whose staunch bad mood is an absolute delight to witness. This old tomcat has been gracing us of his royal presence since we took him out of the asylum four years ago; I guess we are both faithful servants.

How people in the past managed to do without FaceTime and the like, I really do not know.

My friend and ex-boss Gautier ([that sucker](https://readtheblackswan.lu/thoughts/joining-the-guardian/index.html)) warned me that, under this new framework (the official term is [dual-career commuter couple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-career_commuter_couples)), our relationship would evolve and we should be vigilant. If anything, our bond is now stronger than ever. To say that it has been a test is an understatement, but I have a feeling this made us both able to advance more confidently in life.

Our new way of living does not come without its downsides though. I now see my family and friends much less than I used to. Creating new relationships is not particularly one of my forte, but I am lucky enough to have met a few people here which I can now call friends. Still, I miss all of them.

Our modus operandi has also eaten away a good portion of my free time. I am a sucker for learning new things, that is why I usually read two books at the same time and keep my [Feedly](http://feedly.com/i/index) tab open every day. This past year … Let us say my daily consumption has dropped at an all-time low. Obviously, I haven’t *produced* anything valuable either, be it [side projects](https://github.com/regiskuckaertz) or articles. Another irony? I used to complain nothing was ever happening in Luxembourg; well, here it’s the exact opposite. London is a treasure trove of conferences, meetups, hack days, show and tells, workshops and whatnot. I must have gone to less than ten of those.

## Living in the City

As one can imagine, London is a bustling city. It is a place where the possibilities are virtually limitless, whatever one’s aspirations are; as such, it deservedly attracts a lot of people. To the occasional tourist, this is a good thing. For someone living it, day in and day out, it is anything but—at least, such is my experience. 

A whole year has gone by and there still is an aspect of living here that I find completely unbearable. I know through discussions with other colleagues I am not alone in this, but I will dare to say the contrast is even more striking for someone like me, who’s been living for years in a city that is *dead* after 6 o’clock. There is one word for it: commute.

I used to enjoy the ten minutes it took the bus to drive me from home to work; I even occasionally walked all the way through to get some fresh air before work. Needless to say, those days are long gone. Commuting in London is a much worse experience, and I consider myself lucky it only lasts thirty minutes. Now I am not engaging in an exercise of self-pity, I know a lot of people are worse-off by the simple fact they cannot afford to live as close to the city as I do. I am not even complaining about the length of my commute, the lack of space or the sweat. Rather, something particularly unnerving that I felt from day one (and I challenge anyone not to feel it) is that **everyone is in a hurry**.

This doesn’t seem like much; I even remember making fun of those people who ran like it was the last day on Earth. And I know there’s a very good explanation for it: many people have a long commute; missing a connection can delay it by a lot; many trains are extremely crowded; most stations are not fit to accommodate peak hours; hence a tendency to go as fast as possible everywhere. Don’t underestimate the sheer insanity of the situation. Once you go in, this is war. As a by-product, people are extremely rude; they will cut you on your way without even a look or at least a hint of acknowledgment; they will force themselves before you in the escalators, often with a hustle; they will invade your private space without so much as an apology; it is like every encounter is an alpha-male competition.

I’m not afraid to admit there is hardly a day that goes by without me wanting to punch somebody in the face. Clearly, these few minutes in a sea of people are taking a toll on my mental. As a consequence, on my way home I always long for relaxation and meditation, not study, practice or writing.

Fortunately, all of this stress is offset by the reason I moved to London in the first place … work!

## Working for *The Guardian*

Ah, the *plat de résistance*. What is it like to work for a 200 years old company that managed to build a world-class website? Let me give you an outline.

### A sense of belonging

Something that I feel is common across the whole London scene is that everybody *gets* it. You’re literally surrounded by people more talented than you are, all the time. They are curious, challenge-driven, broad-minded and yes, they know their stuff through and through. Whereas in Luxembourg, I hit a rock trying to get my point across with people who were lacking a lot of background and, ultimately, kept most of the knowledge I accumulated over the years to myself, here knowing and sharing is the default setting. And believe me when I say **this feels like family**.

The canonical scenario of many work days goes like this: we have a problem on the site; someone sketches out an idea of how to solve it; someone else riffs off this idea with her own acumen; one draws from her background yet another subtlety; and so on and so forth, sometimes going back to square one, sometimes going forward, until eventually the solution takes a more refined shape. The process goes on and on, in a matter of minutes, or otherwise over several months and many releases. One might say that is the privilege of working on a single product, but that is simply not true. We have [hundreds of projects](https://github.com/guardian), it just so happens that they all culminate to what people are seeing, i.e. the website, the apps and off-platform content.

I used the colloquialism “riff off” by design, because the whole thing sounds like jazz to me, and I feel like I now know what *improvisation* really means. For the first time in my career,  I have found a place where I can fully express and explore the whole breadth of my knowledge, while at the same time keep on pushing its boundaries.

### Being on a mission

Very few organisations are lucky enough to have a history going back centuries, let alone to have built a healthy reputation such as *The Guardian*’s. On my second day of work—it was actually a hack day—one of my colleagues made an introductory speech in which he referenced those famous words of C. P. Scott’s: “*[Comment is free, but facts are sacred](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2002/nov/29/1)*.” This is what *The Guardian* stands for, every one in the organisation is driven by these words; they’re also why, to my eyes, *The Guardian* is a lone star in a sea of pretenders.

We are all conscious of the role we play in the company; there is a shared sense of responsibility, of ownership and, yes, of pride, that is tangible. One can feel it especially when world events unravel—why, did 2016 deliver in that category—and team efforts across the whole company lead to prize-winning Journalism, delivered on time at a staggering pace to a massive crowd of readers.

If it’s good to feel part of something big and important, it’s even more so to know that your work is doing something good, something that moves the World in the right direction, if only one minuscule step at a time. As part of the commercial development team, I feel this is particularly true. These are turbulent times for newspapers around the world, who have to come to terms with the fact that the current advertising model does not work (for them) anymore. But in these days of deep political turmoil, mass surveillance, terrorism, fraud and whatnot, journalism is the one thing nobody wants to see go down; in fact, never in History has there been a time where it has been more important than now. And thus, for the most part of this year and going forward, our mission has been and will be to secure the financial health of *The Guardian*.

### Advertising in a digital world

I had literally zero experience in advertising when I joined *The Guardian*. Certainly I had [some kind of opinion](https://readtheblackswan.lu/thoughts/advertising-on-the-web/index.html), but it was only informed by mere exposure. I started a blank slate, ready to ingurgitate everything that was thrown at me. Well, the codebase is huge, so I thought the best way to use my time was to know how ads are delivered on the site through and through; so I enrolled in the team responsible for solving bugs. I knew each one would force me to dig deep in the code and discover all its subtleties. Soon enough, I became familiar with it and started submitting loads of improvements.

A mental model of the application was starting to take shape in my mind, and I was starving for new opportunities; my enthusiasm was boundless. I was on every thing, were it fixing bugs, adding new features or refactoring entire parts of the code (so much so that teammates started calling me “the canon”). I think I ended up rewriting most of the front-end logic for delivering adverts, even though that was not my intention. But my contributions did not stop at the code; I find the interplay between content and advertising to be a fascinating subject, not only because one doesn’t exist without the other, but also because I believe this is still pretty much *terra incognita* in the digital realm. And so I got myself involved in as much side projects as possible.

Today, I'm leading the development of **native ads**, otherwise known as true responsive ads. I will eventually write more about it, this post has already drawn me far too long. Let's just say for now it is a massive undertaking which can potentially alter the face of online advertising.

What is so special about online advertising anyway? As one would believe, there is more to it than meets the eye. I won’t go in too much details here, but it helps to see it that way:  

- the publisher wants to make as much money as possible on each page view without degrading the user’s experience (that would ultimately destroy its objective in the long run, since less people would come back on the site)
- the advertiser wants to pay as less money as possible to reach the largest portion of its target audience, wherever they are on the Web
- between the publisher and the advertiser, there may be intermediaries, and a lot of them, who essentially serve as hubs between adverts and websites

All in all, it is a dreamworld for computer scientists interested in combinatorial algorithms. For example, an ad on the page is usually selected in a second-price auction—a typical example of online linear programming. Ads are also an incredible challenge from a website development perspective. First, there’s the planning that comes into deciding where, how many and in what size: with a plethora of devices and aspect ratios, this alone can make your head spin. Ok, but what else? Then comes the trafficking, which is all about serving the right ad to the right person and depends on so many factors. Hum, next? Oh yeah, the nasty part: the displaying. Nasty because most of the time we don’t have much control over what an ad does: we do have some power a priori, in terms of written contracts, and some a posteriori, where we can ban ads that misbehave, but there’s a whole spectrum of things that can happen in between.

This particular arrangement does not play particularly in favour of the publisher (and its readers) too: the mere fact that [people visit other websites more often](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/end-of-web-design/) gives intermediaries and advertisers extreme power, especially if they can track people on the Internet—spoiler alert: they can and they do. Targeting, the ability to display specific ads based on someone's browsing history, is perhaps the worst feature of all time: not only is it an invasion of a person's privacy, it is also what drives prices down and allows networks such as Google's and Facebook's to gobble as much as 85% of the generated revenue.

In a nutshell, advertising on the web is effing hard! And that’s why I just can’t get enough of it :-)

### The best website in the Universe

I remember the first time I released something live, the sheer feeling of excitement (and stress) knowing what I made was being seen by thousands of people every second; the feeling of achievement the first time it brought a sizeable chunk of revenue in the bank. It’s a bit like jumping out of an airplane—and I know what it feels like—landing, and going back up immediately. I’m now well over four hundred releases and got used to it somehow, but the cosmic size of these numbers makes it so that even the tiniest change can have dramatic impacts—and the state of responsibility behind such an entitlement never goes away.

What I find most amazing though is the level of coordination and collaboration that makes the site possible at all. It’s easy to take the result for granted when you’re on the outside, but behind the scenes is a myriad of micro-services and applications, all precisely calibrated to come together and provide the necessary feedback loop for the whole organisation to serve its purpose.

Ok, time to put the pen down. Work is amazing. I'm giving myself 100%, but it's not "all work and no play": I'm having **a lot of fun**, like in fact I never did before. And that also explains why, when I come home, I tend to sit back and relax.

Anyway, there hardly is a need for a conclusion here. Once again, I can see things in perspective by bringing my pre-Guardian days forward. There's a world of difference between now and then, but I've come to understand that the level of competence across the disciplines that revolve around web design in Luxembourg---be it in engineering, design, user experience or data science---which is indeed very low in comparison, can only be a by-product of the small size of the market. Not only that, but the limited scale of the traffic itself kills any opportunity to approach a whole bunch of technologies and techniques that are so vital to make the Web work.

In other words, I'm there to stay and keep on exploring what *The Guardian* has to offer.
